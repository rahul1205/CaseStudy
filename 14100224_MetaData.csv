1,"Data quality indicators are based on the coefficient of variation (CV). Quality indicators indicate the following: A - Excellent (CV from 0% to 4.99%); B - Very good (CV from 5% to 9.99%); C - Good (CV from 10% to 14.99%); D - Acceptable (CV from 15% to 24.99%); E - Use with caution (CV from 25% to 34.99%); F - Too unreliable to publish (CV greater than or equal to 35% or sample size is too small to produce reliable estimates)."
2,"Estimates for the latest reference month are preliminary."
4,"The stock of vacant positions on the last business day of the month."
5,"Labour demand is the sum of total payroll employment (met labour demand) and the number of job vacancies (unmet labour demand)."
6,"The job vacancy rate is the number of job vacancies or vacant positions on the last business day of the month as a percentage of labour demand (occupied positions and vacant positions)."
7,"Industrial aggregate covers all industrial sectors except those primarily involved in agriculture, fishing and trapping, private household services, religious organisations and the military personnel of the defence services, federal, provincial and territorial public administration, as well as unclassified businesses. Unclassified businesses are business for which the industrial classification (North American Industry Classification System [NAICS] 2017 Version 3.0) has yet to be determined."
